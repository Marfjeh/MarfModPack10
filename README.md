# MarfModPack 10.

This is a minecraft modpack used for friends. as i do not want to wait for approval at curseforge.


There might be some jar files in mods because of this:

"This mod is excluded from the CurseForge API and must be downloaded manually."

(Or i had to compile them myself, for acedium forexample.)

As i'm only just having fun with your mods, i'm going to rehost them.
cant ask my friends to download a mod manually...
