# MarfModPack 10.

This is a minecraft modpack used for friends. as i do not want to wait for approval at curseforge.


There might be some jar files in jar-binaries because of this:

"This mod is excluded from the CurseForge API and must be downloaded manually."

This is absolute BULLSHIT. so i'm rehosting your mods. i just want to have fun with your mods. :S
